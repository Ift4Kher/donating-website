            <h3>Food for a family</h3>
            <p class="part-one">Donating the cause is very easy and convenient. A unit contribution of Rs 1000 will help
                us in
                distributing roughly 20 meals. You can choose in multiple units of 1,2,3 or more.

                With the funds collected, iCharity, as a reach out partner, of ReNew Power, will purchase the meals and
                distribute them to those who needs it the most in and around Gurgaon.

                Please support this critical work by choosing different units and contribute towards helping the
                community feeding and dry rations distribution.</p>

                We promote free, equal access to quality education for all children – from early learning to secondary
                education. We work with children, their families, communities, wider society and governments, and
                advocate at both local and international levels, so that all children are able to get an education.

            <p class="last-part">You might think about charity as something you do with the extra change you find lying
                around, or by
                supporting a friend running in a local race. That's how we used to feel — until we learned how much even
                a modest amount of charity can accomplish when given to the right organizations.
                It's common for charities to make big promises, and in most cases they can't deliver. But after
                researching hundreds of charities and the programs they carry out, we've found a few that can truly
                demonstrate impact. With these charities, your donation can make a real difference.</p>
